########## Door/Window Binary Sensors Appear as Door/Window ########## 
# Goal: Get door/window sensors to appear in dashboards as "open" or "closed" instead of "on" and "off"
# By default the door/window sensors are "binary_sensor" platform which have an "on" or "off" state.
# By making them a "cover" platform entity they will have a "open" and "closed" state by default.
