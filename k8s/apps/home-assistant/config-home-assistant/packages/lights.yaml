##### Expose Zooz switches as lights #####
# In order to add the zooz switches to a "light group", we have to expose the switches as lights
# Unclear why the Zooz ZEN76 is a `switch` but the ZEN77 (dimmer) is a `light`, but 🤷‍♂️
# See https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.switch/
# Once these are defined as a `light`, it will derive a `light.*` entity id for it based on the name of the light here. 
# For example, `name: Kitchen Sink Light Switch Light` will generate entity id `light.kitchen_sink_light_switch_light`
light:
  - platform: switch
    name: Dining Table Light Switch Light
    entity_id: switch.dining_table_light
  - platform: switch
    name: Hall Light Switch Light
    entity_id: switch.hallway_light_switch_device
  - platform: switch
    name: Kitchen Light Switch Light
    entity_id: switch.kitchen_light
  - platform: switch
    name: Kitchen Sink Light Switch Light
    entity_id: switch.kitchen_sink_light_device
  - platform: switch
    name: Entryway Light Switch Light
    entity_id: switch.entryway_light

    name: Deck Outdoor Light West
    entity_id: switch.deck_outdoor_light_west
  - platform: switch
    name: Front Outdoor Light East
    entity_id: switch.front_outdoor_light_east
  # this one isn't a zooz but same deal: z-wave presents it as a switch and I want to treat it like a light too:
  - platform: switch
    name: "Momma's Desk Lamp Light"
    entity_id: switch.mommas_desk_lamp_on_off
  - platform: switch
    name: "Micah's Desk Lamp Light"
    entity_id: switch.micahs_desk_lamp_on_off
