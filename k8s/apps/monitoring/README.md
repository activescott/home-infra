## Notes to self

### Why not Prometheus Operator?

I looked at https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator and https://grafana.com/blog/2023/01/19/how-to-monitor-kubernetes-clusters-with-the-prometheus-operator/ and found the docs hard to follow. E.g. there is no reference on the CRDs. I found some simple articles on prometheus setup and configuring it with configmaps that looked more straightforward for now.
