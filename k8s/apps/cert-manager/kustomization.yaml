# NOTES:
# - cert-manager resources already have a namespace defined in cert-manager for namespaced resources (some like their CRDs are not namespaced) 
# - cert-manager resources uses the app label already and not all of the resources are under app: cert-manager (e.g. some are `app: cainjector`)
resources:
#- ./namespace.yaml # cert-manager's chart includes this namespace. We leave the file in dir since clean.sh will recognize it and clean it up.
- ./overlays/prod


# NOTE: DO NOT put cert-manager's imported resources into the namespace. Most
#   /are/ but if you put everything in here, it messes up their RBAC rules and
#   errors start happening.
# namespace: cert-manager
